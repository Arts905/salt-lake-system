# Keep the directory structure but ignore content, except .gitkeep if we added it (we didn't, but good practice)
# For now, just ignore storage/ content but maybe we want to keep the folder?
# Let's ignore everything in storage except if we want to keep structure. 
# But user has local images there.
# Better to ignore storage folder content.
